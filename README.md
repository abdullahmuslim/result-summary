- Complete the markup in the most efficient way for ease of transition.
- Add a single CSS breakpoint with styling that fit well on all display.
- dynamically add summary stats with Javascript from [data.json](data.json).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
During the development of the project I discover a linux app that I can use to measure pixels in image, making determination of spacing easier.

### Continued development
I'm getting used to presumming expected time of completion.
I missed my extimated time for completion, I will try to make it in the next project.
